<h1>Basic Info</h1>
<p><mark>Encryption is a part of our everyday life.</mark><p>
<p><mark>From physical locks to digital software, valuable information is stored in various ways.<p></mark>
<p><mark>Computers store information in numbers, and can scramble numbers in order to encode things.</mark><p>
<p><mark>Passwords and other sensitive information are encoded by default, but things like emails are easier to tap into.</mark><p> 
<p><mark>That is why there are additional ciphers people use.</mark><p>

<h1>History of encryption:</h1>
<p><mark>Way back in 50 B.C., Caesar used a cipher in order to send messages to his officers by shifting each letter over 3 letters.</mark><p> 
<p><mark>This primitive cipher was easy enough for a person to decode without a device.</mark><p>  
<p><mark>Since then, locksmiths have been able to create locks that were precise to the millimeter.</mark><p> 
<p><mark>Without the correct key, no one could unlock it.</mark><p>
<p><mark>However, the dawn of World War II led to the creation of a machine that could take in inputs and give an output both ways.</mark><p> 
<p><mark>This was the rise of the enigma machine.</mark><p>
<p><mark>It would take the message and encode it to a level where it was impossible for any human to try all the combinations.</mark><p>  
<p><mark>The code was finally broken in ‘39.</mark><p>
 
<p><mark>Today, the codes we use are much more sophisticated.</mark><p> 
<p><mark>Rather than the five keys Germans used, modern encryption uses two keys.</mark><p> 
<p><mark>However, each key has a nearly infinite number of combinations, and cannot be cracked.</mark><p> 
<p><mark>There is a public key that encodes the information for a private key, which holds a message.</mark><p> 
<p><mark>It takes many months in order to break into one of these messages, so many people try to hack root code.</mark><p>
